 	To cool down or transfer heat away from electronic and mechanical devices heat sinks are used because of there effectiveness. In this report we explore how to use the Finite Element Method to solve the heat equation on a mesh geometry mimicking a heat sink. Different design options are explored where height and number of fins are varied. We argue that it is better to have a higher number of shorter fins than it is to only increase the height. Dirichlet boundary and Robin boundary conditions were chosen on the domain.
