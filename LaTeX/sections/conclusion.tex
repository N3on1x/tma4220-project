\section{Conclusion}
This is the beginning of the conclusion. Here we will sum up the report and the results. Also we will suggest improvements for further work. I am personally very happy about the fact that I have started to write on this. The report is nearly finished, and just some minor work remains.

Sincerely \newline Nicolaj Nielsen
